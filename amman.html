              <h1>Roman amphitheater</h1>
              <img class="img" src="./images/roman-amphitheater.jpg" alt="" />
              <p>
                A Roman theater located in the eastern part of the Jordanian
                capital, Amman, specifically at the foot of Jabal Al-Joufeh, on
                one of the hills opposite the Amman Citadel. A Greek inscription
                on one of the pillars indicates that this amphitheater was built
                in honor of Emperor Madrian, who visited Amman in 130 AD. Next
                to the amphitheater is the Forum Square, and their combined area
                is 7,600 square metres. Its construction probably dates back to
                the second century AD, specifically between 138 AD and 161 AD
                during the reign of Caesar Anthony Pius. Roman amphitheater used
                for musical and theatrical performances. Because of the quality
                of its sound system, it is still used sometimes for artistic
                performances. The theater can accommodate 6,000 spectators,
                which is larger than the southern theater in Jerash.

              <p>
                It is an ancient palace located in Jordan, half a kilometer
                south of the town of Iraq Al-Amir, 35 kilometers west of Amman.
                It dates back to the Hellenistic period in the second century BC
                and was built by Hyrcanos of the Ammonite Tobias dynasty during
                the reign of King Seleucus IV. The Iraq Al-Amir Palace was given
                this name because its entrance resembles the door of the cave,
                and the Prince is Tobias. The palace was 38 meters long and 18
                meters wide. The palace was surrounded by a basin that was
                accessed by water from nearby springs. This palace has two
                entrances: north and south; It consists of two floors, the lower
                floor of which was used for storage and guard rooms, while the
                second floor was not completed because Hyrcanus, who built it,
                committed suicide due to the threat of the Seleucid army to the
                area. The palace is distinguished by the statues that rise above
                it, of eagles and lions, some of them facing each other and some
                of them arching. This indicates the power of Hyrcanus.

                Raghadan Palace was built by the founding King Abdullah I bin
                Al-Hussein, where he lived first - when he came to the city of
                Amman; In a modest house of Ottoman construction opposite the
                Roman amphitheater, a hillock in the Marka area was used as a
                headquarters for receiving delegations and holding celebrations.
                After King Abdullah I succeeded in his negotiations with the
                British, and obtained British recognition of an independent
                government in Transjordan, King Abdullah I chose in 1924 AD a
                high place overlooking the city center of Amman to build the
                headquarters of the governor’s palace, and the new palace was
                named after Raghadan. meaning prosperity and contentment, and to
                be a source of hope and optimism; He also wanted the palace
                building design to be luxurious and aesthetics characterized by
                simplicity and in harmony with the great history of the city of
                Amman.

              <p>
                Or as some call it, “Al-Kharana” Palace is an Umayyad palace
                located in the Jordanian desert along the international road
                heading to Azraq, 65 km east of Amman, and 659 m above sea
                level. The face of the land, which is called Al-Hurra, and this
                is often called Al-Harrana Palace, not the Treasury. The palace
                was built during the reign of Al-Waleed bin Abdul-Malik in the
                year 92 AH corresponding to 710 AD, as evidenced by the presence
                of kufic inscriptions above the door of one of the rooms of its
                second floor.

              <p>
                The palace is distinguished by its wonderful decorations, as a
                number of column capitals were found in its location, which were
                elaborately carved in the Byzantine style, and a complete column
                was found with a beautiful kufic inscription on its crown. The
                huge stones that make up the column bear inscriptions at equal
                distances as evidence of the scales in calligraphy. The palace
                was built on top of Jabal Al-Muwaqar, which is 910 meters above
                sea level, and a series of terraces 65 meters long, 39 meters
                wide, and a wall thickness of approximately 1.15 meters were
                used in its construction. Four towers, two square and two
                semi-circular, and the palace had half-barrel domes similar to
                the domes of the nearby palaces, namely the brick, Omara and
                Al-Mashta.

              <p>
                It is one of the Arab palaces built by the Umayyads in the
                Levant. The palace is located 32 km southeast of Amman. It was
                built by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid bin Yazid in 744 AD. The
                palace is surrounded by a square wall 144 meters long, with 25
                circular towers, except for the two entrance towers, which are
                half octagonal. The palace is located in Jordan in the Giza
                district. The palace is divided into three wings. The middle
                wing is in turn divided into three sections, the northern and
                southern sections, comprising the main buildings. The middle
                section in the middle wing forms an open courtyard. The northern
                wing was the residence of the caliph, while the southern wing is
                corridors, rooms and a mosque, and from it the only entrance
                opens, which is decorated from the outside with an ornate
                facade. However, the most beautiful thing about Qasr al-Mashta
                from a technical point of view is the decoration carved in the
                limestone in the tribal facade in which the entrance is located.
                That facade was transferred to the Department of Islamic Arts in
                the Berlin Museum, and we see in Al-Mashta Palace some artistic
                elements that resemble the decorations of the Dome of the Rock.
