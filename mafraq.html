              <p>
                The roots of settlement in the town of Umm al-Jamal go back to
                the Nabataean period, from the first century BC until the Mamluk
                Islamic period. Archaeological permits revealed the existence of
                a group of ancient dams designed to collect water or transform
                it into reservoirs distributed in and around the ancient city.
                Nabataean writings were revealed on some stones and a large
                altar with Nabataean inscriptions on it. A large number of
                shrines were engraved with the names of their owners.

                The roots of settlement in it go back to the Neolithic era, and
                it took a military dimension in the Roman era and a religious
                dimension in the Byzantine era. As for the Arab-Islamic period
                (Umayyad), this palace was built for recreation and hunting and
                away from the noise of cities. The palace has a bathroom, a
                mosque, and houses. It was used as a stop on the pilgrimage
                trail until the eighth century. In the palace there is a mosque
                dating back to the Umayyad era.
