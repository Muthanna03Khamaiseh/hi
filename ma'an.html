                early tomorrow morning, So we were greeted by a strong wind and
                some rain, so we passed by Khan Unayzah before noon, and I saw
                him in the land of a red desert, with small black stones, and he
                is on the right of the one who is going, and before him in the

                Camp Adrah (Roman) A brief history of the site: The importance

                of the fortified sites that became famous in the history of the
