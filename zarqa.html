                Brief about him: This archaeological area is located within a
                mountain range surrounding the Zarqa River and its tributaries,
                42 km to the southwest of the city of Mafraq and 1 km south of
                the village of Al-Qunia. The mountain rises above sea level (670
                m) and surrounds the site by several important mountains such as
                Jabal Al-Mughniyeh, Al-Magnona Mountains, Al-Mukhadah Mountains
                and Hamid Mountains, as well as a large group of water springs
                that flow into the Zarqa River, such as Oyoun Khurasan, Oyoun
                Al-Deir, Ein Al-Qunia and Oyoun Al-Karm. At the end of the
                Copper Stone Age, the site developed to be a walled city at the
                top of the mountain with an estimated area of ​​thirty acres,
                and it was an important city At the end of this era and in the
                first phase of the Early Bronze Age. This site was famous for
                the presence of burials called stone monuments (dolmens) and
                stony tombs that spread in the Early Bronze Age.

                Brief about him: Jabal al-Rahil is located on a hill that rises
                647 m above sea level to the west of Sukhna, within the
                Palestinian coordinates 249.69 east and 171 north. It was first
                identified by Nelson Gluck in 1935 AD, but no one has visited it
                yet. That date was only in 1988 AD, when Palumbo visited him
                during his survey of the sites of the Early Bronze Age, the
                fourth floor in Jordan. Spread over this hill are many
                archaeological remains of walls and buildings belonging to a
                Mamluk village. These remains are mainly concentrated on the
                northern and eastern slopes. For the hill, the main periods of
                settlement in it date back to the early Bronze Age period.
